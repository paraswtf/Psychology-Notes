## Intelligence and Ability

### Meaning of Intelligence

> According to Binet (1905), "Intelligence refers to comprehension, intention, direction and criticism."

> According to Stern , "Intelligence is a general mental adaptablity to new problems and conditions."

> According to Thurstone (1930), intelligence consists of many primary attributes. Some have also defined intelligence as "flexiblity or versatility in the use of [symbolic processes](/topics/misc/#symbolic-process)."

> David Wechsler defines intelligence as the aggregate or global capacity of the individual to act purposefully, to think rationally and to deal effectively with the enviornment.

### Measurement of Intelligence
The systematic attempt to measure intelligence started with the work of  **Alfred Binet in 1904**. 

Accurate assessment of intelligence is possible only with the help of well developed and standardised intelligence tests.

Since intelligence consists of many different abilities, different intelligence tests are constructed with the purpose of measuring specific set of abilities.
